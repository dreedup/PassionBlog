# The Journey

This is a passion project meant to continue to be worked on post Bootcamp! On this beautiful website youll be able to create a user, sign in and then make a post with pictures and text! (This shall be done by attaching my Unit 2 Project Blog API (https://github.com/dreedup/blogapi) to this Project) Upon finishing that functionality I would like to add functionality for all members alike as well as anonympus users to leave comments of each post!
